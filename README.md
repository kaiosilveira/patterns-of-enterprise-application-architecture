# Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture

This repository contains the working implementation of the patterns described in the "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" (PoEAA) book, by Martin Fowler.

[Base Patterns](https://github.com/kaiosilveira/poeaa-base-patterns): Base patterns are commonly-used approaches to well-known problems, such as creating objects that are only meant to carry certain values ([value objects](https://github.com/kaiosilveira/poeaa-base-patterns)), setting up a `Registry` to keep track of in-memory instances or even simply configuring a `Money` class.
