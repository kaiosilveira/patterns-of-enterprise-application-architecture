# Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture

This repository contains the working implementation of the patterns described in the "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" (PoEAA) book, by Martin Fowler.

## Base patterns

Base patterns are commonly used approaches to well-known problems, such as creating objects that are only meant to carry certain values ([value objects](https://github.com/kaiosilveira/poeaa-base-patterns)), setting up a [Registry](https://github.com/kaiosilveira/poeaa-registry/tree/main) to keep track of in-memory instances or even simply configuring a `Money` class.

* [Value Object](https://github.com/kaiosilveira/poeaa-value-object/tree/main): A small simple object, like money or a date range, whose equality isn’t based on identity
* [Registry](https://github.com/kaiosilveira/poeaa-registry/tree/main): A well-known object that other objects can use to find common objects and services.
